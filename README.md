# Autonomous-Blackjack-using-Epsilon-Greedy
Experimented with reinforcement learning (q-learning policy and epsilon greedy) to simulate blackjack. 
## What is Reinforcement Learning?
In any reinforcement learning task, one needs to define the world in which the agent exists. In general, this comes down to 3 things:

1. State: Where am I?

2. Action: What can I do?

3. Reward: How good were my decisions?

## Why Blackjack?
Blackjack is a pretty simple game that (like RL) can be boiled bown to 3 things:

1. State: What are my cards? What are the dealer's cards? etc

2. Action: Do I hit? Do I stay?

3. Reward: Did I win? Did I lose?

As a result, it's the perfect game to get comfortable with the methods used in RL.
